## [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
A lot of YT videos contain sponsored segments that are part of the video and thus won't get blocked using ordinary adblockers.  
SponsorBlock does exactly that:  
SB users can vote for video segments of different categories which will then be automatically skipped.
It is available as addon for all major browsers and is also included in a lot of 3rd party YT clients.

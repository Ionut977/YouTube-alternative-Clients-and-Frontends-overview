# Useful YT additions
## [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
A lot of YT videos contain sponsored segments that are part of the video and thus won't get blocked using ordinary adblockers.  
What started to only skip segments containing sponsored content can now even skip other categories like intros and outros or even skip right to the point of a video, the so called 'highlight'([Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9FEpB36wZw)).  
Users can vote for video segments will then be automatically skipped.
It is available as addon for all major browsers and is also included in a lot of 3rd party YT clients.  
**Does the usage of SponsorBlock have an influence on creators' revenue?**  
According to a [video of LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9FEpB36wZw) published in feb. 2020 it does not.
Some people even made projects that can free downloaded YT videos of such segments such as [SponSkrub](https://github.com/faissaloo/SponSkrub).
